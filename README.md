# undergrad_ai

Included is a sample of some AI functions I implemented as part of an AI class at Holy Cross with Prof. Fitzsimmons

The majority of projects from this course were collaborative, thus I'll be keeping them private...

Projects include: decision tree architecture, SAT solving Akari, A* Heuristic search & analysis, minimax implementation, etc.
